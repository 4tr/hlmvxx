# hlmvxx
Half Life Model Viever inject additional functions
[example of functions](img/preview.png)
HLMV binary files for GarrysMod are used!

The only feature added now is the ability to edit attachments faster with sliders in the interface.  Also there is a function of external call of the attachment configuration script handler (temporarily disabled).

In the [GarrysMod.zip](GarrysMod.zip) file there is hlmv.exe v2.0 from April 11, 2025 and the file hlmvxx.exe, which creates a code injection into the main file every time you run it. 

Many thanks to Kmeaw for solving technical difficulties and adding Crowbar compatibility.  

For the injection to work successfully, it is necessary to copy 
hlmvxx.exe
hlmvxx.dll
hlmv_v2.0_11_04_2025.exe
into the */GarrysMod/bin/win64 directory.
and run hlmvxx.exe or customize the Crowbar to run hlmvxx.
